I'm an Electrical Engineer, Data & AI Enthusiast and part-time Graphic Designer that would like to gain the industrial grade of softskill and hardskill to hopefully, become one of the future leader that could manage all services running across platform. I also seek for an opportunity to learn and watch the expert to have a better understanding about the real industrial challenge.
